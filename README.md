# Delete-Playstation-SDK-Files
Deletes Playstation PC SDK files from Spiderman 2 folder

Uninstall Playstation PC SDK using Windows add or remove programs.
Put batch file in directory for Spiderman 2.
Double click or run batch file and follow instructions.
This file deletes itself after use to save space.

You may get an error code about missing files upon launching Spiderman 2, but it is safe to ignore.

This file isn't pretty or overly overly useful to most people, but Playstation has decided to start adding unnecessary applications into games to track players. These applications are unethical and slow the game down noticeably.

Hope you enjoy.
